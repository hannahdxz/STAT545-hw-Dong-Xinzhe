**Report of my process:**

* At first I had difficulty load the figure I previously saved to file. They after I added `.png` after the name of the saved plot, it works!

* This tutorial about the [forcats package](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/08/31/forcats-0-1-0/) is really helpful.

* In the section *Visualization design*, if I render the plots side by side, the plots become very narrow and parts of the plots will be lost. So I rendered them on top of each other.

* I am a little bit confused about what we should do in the *I want to do more* section, I did the task based on my own understanding of the problem.
