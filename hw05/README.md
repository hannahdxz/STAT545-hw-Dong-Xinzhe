**Report of my process:**

* At first I had difficulty load the figure I previously saved to file. They after I added `.png` after the name of the saved plot, it works!

* This tutorial about the [forcats package](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/08/31/forcats-0-1-0/) is really helpful.

* I am a little bit confused about what we should do in the *I want to do more* section, I did the task based on my own understanding of the problem.

* I used the funcion `multiplot()` on [this website](http://stat545.com/block020_multiple-plots-on-a-page.html) to render two of my plots together.
