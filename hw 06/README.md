**Report of my process:**

* At first I had difficulty understanding the `tidy()` function, then I found [this tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html) online, I think it has some good examples.

* I referred to this [webpage](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html) when I tried to write linear and robust regression functions. 

* This [Split-Apply-Combine tutorial](http://stat545.com/block024_group-nest-split-map.html) is very helpful, the inspiration of my work in the section "work with a nested dataframe" is from this tutorial.

* I used the funcion `multiplot()` from [this website](http://stat545.com/block020_multiple-plots-on-a-page.html) to render two of my plots together.

* I tried some of the exercises from the [String chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html). I will return to this and work on more problems from this chapter in the future.
