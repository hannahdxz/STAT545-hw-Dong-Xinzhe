**Report of my process:**

* I referred to this [webpage](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html) when I tried to write linear and robust regression functions. 

* This [Split-Apply-Combine tutorial](http://stat545.com/block024_group-nest-split-map.html) is very helpful, the inspiration of my work in the section **work with a dataframe** is from this tutorial.

* I used the funcion `multiplot()` from [this website](http://stat545.com/block020_multiple-plots-on-a-page.html) to render two of my plots together.
