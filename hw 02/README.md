## Report of my process: 

* Here is the [link](https://github.com/hannahdxz/STAT545-hw-Dong-Xinzhe/blob/master/hw%2002/hw-02_Rmarkdown.md) to the rendered .md file.
* At first I had some difficulty creating a folder for all the files of my hw02. Then I figured out I can do it through **Files>New folder** in R studio.
* I also struggled a little while about creating a README for my hw02 folder, then I figured out that I can do it by **creating a Rmarkdown file, changing the output to github_document, and naming it README**.
* The exploration of the gapminder data went smoothly. We covered everything in class.
* The extra problems took me some time, I first had difficulty understanding why the code ``` filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))``` did not work, but I talked to my classmates then I understood. 
* I find this [ggplot tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial/blob/master/gapminder-ggplot2-univariate-quantitative.md) very helpful.
* Here is a [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) I refer to when working with Rmarkdown.
