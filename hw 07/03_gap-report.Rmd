This is an R Markdown document. In this example, its purpose is to allow us to demonstrate how to use `rmarkdown::render()` without the help of RStudio's buttons. We will, in fact, call `rmarkdown::render()` from within a `Makefile`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

# bring the data in as data frame
gapminder <- read.delim("gapminder_reorder.tsv")

## make some plots

# a boxplot of lifeExp and continents
p1 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) + geom_boxplot()
ggsave("boxplot_of_lifeExp_and_continents.png", p1)
```
