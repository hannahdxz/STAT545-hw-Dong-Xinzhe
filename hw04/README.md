**Report of my process**

* When I was practicing join() functions to merge two dataframes, I realized that they don't work for multiple dataframes, I am just wondering if there is a way I can join multiple dataframes.

* Exploration of the gapminder using join() and gather() functions went well, we covered everything in class.

* I think Jenny's [notes and example](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-gather.md) about the gather() function is really helpful.
